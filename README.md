üìñ About the Project
The INSTAGRAM SQL project aims to replicate the fundamental database structure of Instagram. It includes tables for users, posts, likes, comments, and follower relationships. This project serves as a practical exercise to understand and implement relational database concepts and SQL queries.

üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema
The database consists of the following tables:

Users: Stores user information such as username, email, and profile details.

Posts: Contains data about user posts, including captions, timestamps, and associated media.

Likes: Tracks which users have liked which posts.

Comments: Records comments made by users on posts.

Followers: Manages follower-following relationships between users.

Note: An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is included in the repository to visualize the database structure.

üîç Features
User Management: Create and manage user profiles.

Post Creation: Users can create posts with captions and media.

Like Functionality: Users can like posts.

Commenting System: Users can comment on posts.

Follow System: Users can follow and unfollow other users.

Data Analytics: Perform queries to analyze user engagement, popular posts, and more.

üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
MySQL or PostgreSQL installed on your machine.

A database client like MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-sql.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd instagram-sql
Import the database schema:

Open your database client.

Create a new database named instagram_clone.

Import the schema.sql file to set up the tables.

Populate the database with sample data (optional):

Import the sample_data.sql file to add sample records.

üß™ Sample Queries
Here are some example queries you can run on the database:

Retrieve the top 5 most liked posts:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT post_id, COUNT(user_id) AS like_count
FROM Likes
GROUP BY post_id
ORDER BY like_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
Find users with the most followers:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT followed_id, COUNT(follower_id) AS follower_count
FROM Followers
GROUP BY followed_id
ORDER BY follower_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
Get the most active commenters:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT user_id, COUNT(comment_id) AS comment_count
FROM Comments
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY comment_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
Feel free to explore more queries in the queries.sql file included in the repository.

üìä Advanced Analytics
Leverage the database to perform advanced analytics:

User Engagement Metrics: Analyze user activity levels, such as average likes per post or comment frequency.

Content Performance: Identify which types of posts garner the most engagement.

Growth Tracking: Monitor follower growth over time for users.

These insights can be valuable for understanding user behavior and improving platform features.

‚úÖ Best Practices
To ensure optimal performance and maintainability:

Normalization: The database is designed to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

Indexing: Indexes are applied to frequently queried fields to enhance performance.

Security: Sensitive information, such as passwords, should be stored securely using hashing algorithms.

Scalability: The schema is structured to accommodate future growth and additional features.
